## üòª Main benefits for joining Jaguar28:

- **TRANSPARENCY**

We are sick of thousands of cryptic job descriptions from ‚Äúleading companies‚Äù that are looking for ‚Äúmotivated professionals‚Äù in exchange of ‚Äúcompetitive salaries‚Äù. Our goal is to become the One Stop Shop for tech professionals happy to consider new job opportunities in the most comprehensive and effective way.
- **MARKET OVERVIEW**

Even if you are not planning to change job in the next few months, joining Jaguar28 is a great way to see how your skills are valued on the market or on which technologies you shall focus in the future.
- **500‚Ç¨ SIGNING AND REFERRAL BONUS**

Once you have completed the probation period, we will send you ‚Ç¨ 500 signing bonus: it is our way to say ‚Äúthank you!‚Äù for the positive outcome. Also, we invite you to promote Jaguar28 amongst yout friends and contacts: we will reward you with a ‚Ç¨ 500 referral bonus for each friend that changes jobs on the platform.
- **AGENCY-FREE AREA**

Last but not least, you will never ever find headhunters or other intermediaries here. Also, companies that will hire you and use you skills through body rentals schemes are not welcome: we consider them part of the problem, not the solution.
